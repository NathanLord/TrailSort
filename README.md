# Intro

TrailSort is an application that sorts a folder of images into subdirectories based on their identification.

TrailSort uses an image classification convolutional neural network model to sort images. The current model is set up to sort based on: Whitetail Deer, Black Bear, Coyote, Ruffed Grouse, and Turkey.
